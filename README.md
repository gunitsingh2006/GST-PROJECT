# 🤖 AI GST Reconciliation Assistant

A smart, AI-powered system to automate and streamline GST invoice reconciliation for businesses and enterprises. This tool minimizes manual efforts, reduces compliance errors, and ensures accuracy in filing by intelligently matching invoices with GSTR returns.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

GST filing is often repetitive, error-prone, and time-consuming. Manual reconciliation of invoices with GSTR-2A and GSTR-3B leads to:

- ⚠️ Filing delays  
- 💸 Penalties and missed Input Tax Credit (ITC)  
- 🛑 Compliance issues  

Manual approaches don’t scale well when invoice volume grows into the hundreds or thousands.

## 🚀 Solution Overview

The **AI GST Reconciliation Assistant** solves this using a combination of AI/ML and rule-based logic to:

- ✅ Automatically match purchase/sales invoices with GSTR-2A & GSTR-3B  
- ❗ Detect missing entries, mismatches, incorrect GSTINs or invoice dates  
- 📝 Generate GST Match Reports  
- ⚠️ Flag risky vendors and common error patterns  
- 📁 Support bulk uploads and report exports
